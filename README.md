# Building a Simple To-Do List Web Application

## Introduction

- A **to-do list web application** is a simple and useful tool that allows users to manage their tasks and stay organized.
- In this project, you will build a web application that allows users to **create**, **edit**, and **delete** tasks, as well as mark tasks as **complete**.
- The application will use **local storage** to store the tasks, so that they are persisted even when the user refreshes the page or closes the browser.

## Prerequisites

- **Basic understanding** of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Designing the User Interface

### Task List

- Create a **task list** that displays all tasks added by the user.
  - Each task should include a **checkbox** to mark the task as complete, a **description** of the task, and a **button** to delete the task.
  - Use an HTML `<ul>` element to create the task list, and use `<li>` elements to represent each task.

### Form

- Include a **form** that allows the user to add new tasks to the list.
  - The form should include a **text input** for the task description and a **submit button**.
  - Use an HTML `<form>` element to create the form, and an `<input>` element for the text input and button.

### Styling

- Use CSS to **style** the application and make it visually appealing.

## Implementing the Frontend

### Handling Events

- Use JavaScript to **handle events** such as form submissions and button clicks.
  - Use **event listeners** to listen for these events and write functions to **handle them**.

### Storing Tasks in Local Storage

- Use the JavaScript `localStorage` object to **store the tasks** in the user's browser.
  - The `localStorage` object allows you to store **key-value pairs**, which you can use to store the tasks as an array.

### Retrieving, Adding, Editing, and Deleting Tasks

- Write functions to **retrieve** the tasks from local storage, as well as **add**, **edit**, and **delete** tasks.

### Manipulating the DOM

- Use JavaScript to **manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM)** in order to update the task list and add new tasks.
  - Use the `innerHTML` property to **update the HTML** of an element, or use functions such as `createElement` and `appendChild` to **add new elements** to the DOM.
